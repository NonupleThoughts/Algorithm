Those files are implementation of insertsort using array.

a-----the times of find
b-----the times of move
x-----the time of find cost
y-----the time of move cost

After analyzing, i think that method 1 need ax + by and method 2 need b(x + y), and the size relationship between a and b is random, so i think the two are the same in efficiency.

Those file is implementation of InsertSort.

And for more detail about InsertSort, please go to wiki.


Addition:
Firstly i want to use inherit and template to create a class (linked list), then use linked list class to implement insertsort.


But after thinking i believe there is no need to use inherit to create a linked list class, beause the datastruct-----"node" is very simple.

Besides when i try to use linked list class to implement it, i find that insertsort could be a function of the class. 
And actually there is no need to use insertsort to sort the data of a object of linked list class out of the class.
(I am sorry that i don't know how to explain it clearly and accurately.)

As a result, i delete insertsort.cpp and insertsort.h and use insertsort to sort data  in the linked_list.h.

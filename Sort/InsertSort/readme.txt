Achieve it before evaluating an implementation or comparing it with others.

Such as using linked_list to implement InsertSort, I just feel that using linked_list to implement Insertsort will be efficient to array , but i don't analyze it seriously.
And when i want to use linked_list to implement ShellSort, i find that i am not sure which one (linked list or array) is more efficient.


As a result, I believe that I should achieve it before evaluating an implementation or comparing it with others.

Maybe I need a notebook to help me keep it in mind.
